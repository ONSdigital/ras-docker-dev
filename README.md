## Testing the installation
  
### IAC Activation
  The installation uploads the required data to run through a user journey. It requires activation of the iac ï»¿4kyznty4fw3s, in the rm-postgres DB in iac.iac. This is done by toggling the active boolean.
  
  The rest of the test data is valid for a run through of an entire user journey. 
 
###  Activating the email
   The activation url for email can be pulled from the party-service logs, append the url to the frontstage location and hit from a browser to finish activation.
